# CS Scripting: External JavaScript

This repository demonstrates the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù concept of separating JavaScript from HTML ‚Äî a cutting-edge best practice from the early 2000s.

## Overview

All scripts live in a dedicated `.js` file like true professionals. HTML remains untouched by logic (for the most part), and CSS is exactly where you'd expect: ignored.

## Project Goals

- Create illusion of clean separation of concerns
- Look professional while doing very basic DOM stuff
- Make something work and pretend it's scalable

## How to Use

Open `index.html` in any browser made after 1995.  
Or visit the Netlify preview (hosted because GitHub Pages wasn‚Äôt enough):

## Technologies Used

- HTML (barely)
- JavaScript (slightly more)
