# 🎀 CS Scripting: External JavaScript

This repository demonstrates the “advanced” concept of separating JavaScript from HTML — a cutting-edge best practice from the early 2000s.

---

## 📄 Overview

- All scripts live in a dedicated `.js` file like true professionals  
- HTML remains untouched by logic (for the most part)  
- CSS is exactly where you'd expect: ignored

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create illusion of clean separation of concerns  
- Look professional while doing very basic DOM stuff  
- Make something work and pretend it's scalable  

---

## 💻 How to Use

- Open `index.html` in any browser made after 1995  
- Or visit the Netlify preview (hosted because GitHub Pages wasn’t enough):

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML (barely)  
- JavaScript (slightly more)
